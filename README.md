# Workspace
The workspaces I use reguarly (with a installation script).

It will setup Atom with docker, and git clone this repository of docker images in each of their workspaces.

##Â Setup & Usage

Oneliner setup:
```bash
curl -so workspace.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hill-a/workspace/master/workspace.sh && chmod +x ./workspace.sh && ./workspace.sh
```
